# You Decide

> Have you ever gone back and forth with a friend on deciding where to eat? “No, you decide,” they urge, to which you reply, "No, you!" 
>
> With *You Decide*, you can find a food place nearby instantly and know exactly where to eat.
>
> “No you” no more!

[You Decide](https://tsangela.github.io/you-decide) dynamically displays eateries and their respective metadata as small cards in a clean layout so that you can see all your options at a glance. Upon clicking each card, a modal pops up with further details such as the eatery’s price point, distance, address, availability, and directions. From there, you may freely browse the various food options and make a decision. However, if the you should feel extra indecisive, You Decide can recommend you a random eatery, eliminating indecisiveness once and for all.
